# Design Analysis for Jamovi

This module is a tool for performing Post-Data Design Analysis.

The current tools available are:

- Dichotomous Differential Item Functioning (D.DIF) for assessing DIF on dichotomously scored items using a generalized linear model framework (GLIM). By incorporating the GLIM family of methods for detecting DIF in a user-friendly interface, the technical barrier to assessing DIF has been greatly reduced. The development of techniques for assessing of Type-S and Type-M error rates (Gelman & Carlin, 2014) on DIF-classification thresholds represents a revolution in the interpretability of DIF-flagging, especially in the context of low-powered research settings. The goal developing this module is to encourage the use of the the GLIM framework in the broader psychosocial measure validation praxis.
